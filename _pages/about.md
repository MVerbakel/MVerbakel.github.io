I'm a Data Scientist with over a decade of experience applying statistics and machine learning in tech, finance, and government. I would define my career as continuously learning how to ask better questions, and make good decisions with imperfect data. This is a space where I occasionally collect my thoughts on a topic that I think is useful to share with others. However, I spent most of my spare time these days hanging out with my husband and son.
