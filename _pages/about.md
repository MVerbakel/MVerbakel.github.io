I'm a data scientist with almost a decade of experience applying statistics and machine learning in tech, finance, and government. Starting out with a business degree, a chance placement in a research team led to my love of all things data and statistics. While working full time, I completed postgraduate studies in statistics at Canberra University, and earned a Masters in Business Analytics from Deakin University. These days I'm a data scientist in a global travel company in Amsterdam. I'm endlessly curious, so I continue to spend my spare time studying and learning new/creative techniques to improve my work. However, to balance all that time at my desk, I love to travel, hike, and have a coffee in the park with my husband.
